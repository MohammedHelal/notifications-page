## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animations
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Build Tool

### What I learned

I learned a lot building the counter most of all, my aim was to minimize the amount of code I would have to write and build one component for all the notification cards and still be able to track the state of each one.

I also included an inital state of unread notifications and ended up using useEffect hook to render the inital state of the notification cards.

All in all this was a lot of fun to build.
